# How to Contribute

We're trying to build the best database of city flags on the internet. And we need your help to do that!

## Adding a Flag

* Create a topic branch.
* Make commits to `src/city-flags.js`, adding blocks of JSON in the following style:

    ```
      {
        "city": "",
        "state": "",
        "country": "",
        "link": "",
        "image": "",
        "lat": ,
        "lon": 
      }
      ```

* Sort the code using `grunt sort`.
* Submit a Pull Request, detailing the city or cities you're adding
